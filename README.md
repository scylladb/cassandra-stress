# Cassandra Stress

The `cassandra-stress` tool is used for benchmarking and load testing both
ScyllaDB and Cassandra clusters. The cassandra-stress tool also supports
testing arbitrary CQL tables and queries to allow users to benchmark
their data model.

This documentation focuses on user mode as this allows the testing of
your actual schema.

## Installation

The latest version of `cassandra-stress` at the time of
writing this document is **3.17.0**. Please check the latest version on
the [GitHub releases
page](https://github.com/scylladb/cassandra-stress/releases)

There are multiple ways to install [cassandra-stress]{.title-ref}
provided by ScyllaDB. Choose the method that best suits your
environment.

1. **Use Docker Image (Official Way)**
2. **Download Prebuilt Binaries**
3. **Build from Source**
4. **Build Docker Image from Source**

## Use Docker Image (Official Way)

The recommended and official way to use [cassandra-stress]{.title-ref}
is through the Docker image provided by ScyllaDB. This ensures a
consistent and ready-to-use environment.

You can pull the latest Docker image from Docker Hub:

``` shell
docker pull scylladb/cassandra-stress:latest
```

The latest tag is always paired with the version tag on
GitHub, such as **3.17.0**. To check all available tags, visit:

[Docker Hub Cassandra-Stress
Tags](https://hub.docker.com/r/scylladb/cassandra-stress/tags)

Once downloaded, you can run [cassandra-stress]{.title-ref} directly:

``` shell
docker run --rm scylladb/cassandra-stress <commands>
```

If you need to use a specific version, replace [latest]{.title-ref} with
the desired version tag:

``` shell
docker pull scylladb/cassandra-stress:3.17.0
docker run --rm scylladb/cassandra-stress:3.17.0 <commands>
```

#### Performance Penatly

When running in a Docker container, you might experience a performance penalty due to the containerization overhead. To mitigate this, you can use the `--network=host` option to run the container in the host network namespace. This option allows the container to share the host's network stack, which can improve performance.
`--security-opt seccomp=unconfined` allow unrestricted system calls inside the container maily `ioctl`, `iopl` and `clone`.

``` shell
docker run --rm --network=host --security-opt seccomp=unconfined scylladb/cassandra-stress <commands>
```

### Download Prebuilt Binaries

You can download the prebuilt binaries directly from our GitHub
releases.

**Prerequisite**: Ensure that Java Runtime Environment (JRE) version 11
or newer is installed on your system.

**Using \`curl\`:**

``` shell
curl -LO https://github.com/scylladb/cassandra-stress/releases/download/v3.17.0/cassandra-stress-3.17.0-bin.tar.gz
curl -LO https://github.com/scylladb/cassandra-stress/releases/download/v3.17.0/cassandra-stress-3.17.0-bin.tar.gz.sha256
```

**Using \`wget\`:**

``` shell
wget https://github.com/scylladb/cassandra-stress/releases/download/v3.17.0/cassandra-stress-3.17.0-bin.tar.gz
wget https://github.com/scylladb/cassandra-stress/releases/download/v3.17.0/cassandra-stress-3.17.0-bin.tar.gz.sha256
```

**Verify the download using \`sha256sum\`:**

``` shell
sha256sum -c cassandra-stress-3.17.0-bin.tar.gz.sha256
```

If the verification is successful, you will see:

``` text
cassandra-stress-3.17.0-bin.tar.gz: OK
```

    ```

    To build with custom driver jar, put jar into root repo directory and run build command:
    ```shell
    docker build -t cassandra-stress --build-arg BUILD_OPTS=-Dlib.override.com.scylladb.scylla-driver-core=/app/<jar-file-name>.jar --compress .
    ```

Once built, you can run the image locally using:

``` shell
docker run --rm cassandra-stress <commands>
```


## Usage

### Examples

``` console
tools/bin/cassandra-stress write n=1000000 -node 192.168.1.101 # 1M inserts to given host
tools/bin/cassandra-stress read n=10000000 -node 192.168.1.101 -o read # 1M reads
tools/bin/cassandra-stress write -node 192.168.1.101,192.168.1.102 n=10000000 # 10M inserts spread across two nodes
tools/bin/cassandra-stress help -pop # Print help for population distribution option
```

Or run it in a container, please don't miss the quotes around the command line:

``` console
docker run scylladb/cassandra-stress 'cassandra-stress write n=100000 -node 1.2.3.4'
```

Or use the container interactively:

``` console
docker run --rm -d --name c-s -it --entrypoint=/bin/bash -i scylladb/cassandra-stress:latest
docker exec -it c-s /bin/bash
```

There are several operation types:

* write-only, read-only, and mixed workloads of standard data
* write-only and read-only workloads for counter columns
* user configured workloads, running custom queries on custom schemas
* The syntax is cassandra-stress \<command\> \[options\]. If you want
    more information on a given command or options, just run
    cassandra-stress help

### Commands

* read: Multiple concurrent reads - the cluster must first be populated by a write test
* write: Multiple concurrent writes against the cluster
* mixed: Interleaving of any basic commands, with configurable ratio and distribution - the cluster must first be populated by a write test
* counter_write: Multiple concurrent updates of counters.
* counter_read: Multiple concurrent reads of counters. The cluster must first be populated by a counterwrite test.
* user: Interleaving of user provided queries, with configurable ratio and distribution.
  See <http://www.datastax.com/dev/blog/improved-cassandra-2-1-stress-tool-benchmark-any-schema>
* help: Print help for a command or option
* print: Inspect the output of a distribution definition
* legacy: Legacy support mode

### Primary Options

* `-pop`: Population distribution and intra-partition visit order
* `-insert`: Insert specific options relating to various methods for batching and splitting partition updates
* `-col`: Column details such as size and count distribution, data generator, names, comparator and if super columns should be used
* `-rate`: Thread count, rate limit or automatic mode (default is auto)
* `-mode`: Thrift or CQL with options
* `-errors`: How to handle errors when encountered during stress
* `-sample`: Specify the number of samples to collect for measuring latency

* `-transport`: Custom transport factories
* `-port`: The port to connect to cassandra nodes on
* `-sendto`: Specify a stress server to send this command to
* `-graph`: Graph recorded metrics
* `-tokenrange`: Token range settings

## User mode

User mode allows you to use your stress your own schemas. This can save
time in the long run rather than building an application and then
realising your schema doesn't scale.

### Profile

User mode requires a profile defined in YAML. Multiple YAML files may be
specified in which case operations in the ops argument are referenced as
specname.opname.

An identifier for the profile:

``` cql
specname: staff_activities
```

The keyspace for the test:

``` cql
keyspace: staff
```

CQL for the keyspace. Optional if the keyspace already exists:

``` cql
keyspace_definition: |
CREATE KEYSPACE stresscql WITH replication = {'class': 'SimpleStrategy', 'replication_factor': 3};
```

The table to be stressed:

``` cql
table: staff_activities
```

CQL for the table. Optional if the table already exists:

``` cql
table_definition: |
CREATE TABLE staff_activities (
name text,
when timeuuid,
what text,
PRIMARY KEY(name, when, what)
)
```

Optional meta information on the generated columns in the above table.
The min and max only apply to text and blob types. The distribution
field represents the total unique population distribution of that column
across rows:

``` cql
columnspec:
- name: name
  size: uniform(5..10) # The names of the staff members are between 5-10 characters
  population: uniform(1..10) # 10 possible staff members to pick from
- name: when
  cluster: uniform(20..500) # Staff members do between 20 and 500 events
- name: what
  size: normal(10..100,50)
```

Supported types are:

An exponential distribution over the range \[min..max\]:

``` cql
EXP(min..max)
```

An extreme value (Weibull) distribution over the range \[min..max\]:

``` cql
EXTREME(min..max,shape)
```

A gaussian/normal distribution, where mean=(min+max)/2, and stdev is
(mean-min)/stdvrng:

``` cql
GAUSSIAN(min..max,stdvrng)
```

A gaussian/normal distribution, with explicitly defined mean and stdev:

``` cql
GAUSSIAN(min..max,mean,stdev)
```

A uniform distribution over the range \[min, max\]:

``` cql
UNIFORM(min..max)
```

A fixed distribution, always returning the same value:

``` cql
FIXED(val)
```

If preceded by \~, the distribution is inverted

Defaults for all columns are size: uniform(4..8), population:
uniform(1..100B), cluster: fixed(1)

Insert distributions:

``` cql
insert:
# How many partition to insert per batch
partitions: fixed(1)
# How many rows to update per partition
select: fixed(1)/500
# UNLOGGED or LOGGED batch for insert
batchtype: UNLOGGED
```

Currently all inserts are done inside batches.

Read statements to use during the test:

``` cql
queries:
   events:
      cql: select *  from staff_activities where name = ?
      fields: samerow
   latest_event:
      cql: select * from staff_activities where name = ?  LIMIT 1
      fields: samerow
```

Running a user mode test:

``` cql
cassandra-stress user profile=./example.yaml duration=1m "ops(insert=1,latest_event=1,events=1)" truncate=once
```

This will create the schema then run tests for 1 minute with an equal
number of inserts, latest_event queries and events queries. Additionally
the table will be truncated once before the test.

The full example can be found here yaml

Running a user mode test with multiple yaml files:

```shell
cassandra-stress user profile=./example.yaml,./example2.yaml duration=1m “ops(ex1.insert=1,ex1.latest_event=1,ex2.insert=2)” truncate=once
```

This will run operations as specified in both the example.yaml and
example2.yaml files. example.yaml and example2.yaml can reference the
same table although care must be taken that the table definition is
identical (data generation specs can be different).

### Graphing

Graphs can be generated for each run of stress.

![image](example-stress-graph.png)

To create a new graph:

``` cql
cassandra-stress user profile=./stress-example.yaml "ops(insert=1,latest_event=1,events=1)" -graph file=graph.html title="Awesome graph"
```

To add a new run to an existing graph point to an existing file and add
a revision name:

``` cql
cassandra-stress user profile=./stress-example.yaml duration=1m "ops(insert=1,latest_event=1,events=1)" -graph file=graph.html title="Awesome graph" revision="Second run"
```
